Workload Identity Federation

Workload Identity Federation (WIF) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a security feature that allows your external workloads running outside of GCP to access GCP resources without needing to manage long-lived service account keys. It provides a more secure and manageable alternative to traditional service account key-based authentication.

You can find more details about enabling keyless authentication from GitHub Actions here.

Here's a breakdown of how WIF works:

Workload Identity Pool: You create a workload identity pool in your GCP project. This pool serves as a container for trusted external identities (e.g., GitHub Actions runner, CI/CD server).

Workload Identity Provider: You configure a workload identity provider within the pool. This provider specifies how external identities will be mapped to GCP identities. Common providers include GitHub, Azure Active Directory, and AWS IAM.

External Workload Authentication: When your external workload (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow) needs to access GCP resources, it authenticates with its own identity provider (e.g., GitHub).

Token Exchange: The external identity provider issues a short-lived token for the workload. This token is then exchanged with the GCP Security Token Service (STS) using the configured workload identity provider.

Federated Token Issuance: The GCP STS verifies the external token and, if valid, issues a temporary GCP access token with specific permissions granted to the workload identity pool's service account.

GCP Resource Access: The external workload uses the temporary GCP access token to access authorized GCP resources. This token has a limited lifespan and specific permissions, enhancing security.

Benefits of Workload Identity Federation:

Improved Security: Eliminates the need to store and manage long-lived service account keys within your external workloads or repositories, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
Automatic Key Rotation: WIF leverages short-lived tokens that automatically expire, mitigating the need for manual key rotation.
Simplified Management: Focuses permission management on the service account associated with the workload identity pool within GCP.
Fine-grained Access Control: Allows you to grant specific IAM permissions to the service account, ensuring workloads only have the necessary access to GCP resources.
Use Cases for WIF:

CI/CD pipelines running in external platforms like GitHub Actions or Jenkins that need to interact with GCP resources.
Serverless functions or applications deployed outside GCP that require access to GCP services.
Any external workload that needs secure and temporary access to GCP resources.
